# rAbbIt

A game about an AI that is in desperate need of your help for his mission to catch fuzzy rabbits.

I made this game during a company game jam some time ago, but used some JS framework. Now it is time to revive it in Elms glory!

The current version is actually playable, though it doesn't look like much... And there are still a lot of improvements to be done :)

If you want to try it run:
elm make rabbitView.elm rabbitModel.elm rabbit.elm --output=rabbit.js
